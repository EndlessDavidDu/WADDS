## Assigment Two
The Team:

Our Team Name is WADDS, which consists of the first letters of each of our names. Our goal for this semester is to learn how to use R to solve problems in a data science team setting. We hope to learn how to effectively communicate results and processes so we can analyze the world around us.

As for my goals post-graduation go, my dreams consist of two parts: writing and math. In general, I want to write novels and work in data science and statistics. Six months after graduation, I would hope to have a job working with data, though I'm open to what company it's for. Five years later though, I hope to have experience working for a variety of places; I don't want to just stay stuck in the first job I get. I want to explore different locations, companies, projects, etc. and use data science to learn about many different facets of our world that I've never explored before. On the writing side, I hope to be writing and publishing books in my free time--something along the style of Annie Dillard meets Stephen King, if such a thing could possibly exist. 

This leads me to one question I would like to know the answer to that could be answered by analyzing data: are there any significant patterns in traits of people who historically read more horror novels? It could be an interesting way to find out more about audiences I may be writing towards in the future. 

Thinking more in the long run about my goals, I admit that I don't know the full potential of what I could do with data science, or what my greatest career accomplishment could be. I feel there's so much unexplored territory that there is potential to use data to give a company information to make very great change in the world, and I hope I can be a part of that. 

Given these goals, I hope to get all the essential tools for data science in this course that will be readily applicable to the real world. I have relatively little experience, and I'm hoping by the end of the course I feel confident in my ability to turn large data sets into knowledge that can be used. 

And as for something that's not included in the questions, I love animals. I have two dogs and two cats at home where I grew up, and my roommates and I just adopted a kitten this summer names Pants. Below, is a picture of one of my dogs, Max.

### Abby Nay

One question I would like to know the answer to that could be answered by analyzing data: is a carbon tax the most effective way to combat anthropogenic climate change?

Six months after graduation I would like to be working at a bigger company such as HP or Intel, who offer student loan repayment assistance. I would like to be close to paying off my debts the six months immediately following graduation. Five years after that I would like to be working in research that can make a positive impact on the world. I would love to be paid to analyze data related to climate change, poverty programs, or human rights campaigns across the world.

I hope my greatest career accomplishment will be in the research I hope to be a part of later in life. If I can find a significant way to protect the environment I would consider that my greatest accomplishment. I aim to use data to successfully argue for worldwide change.

In this course I'm hoping to gain skills to become a better data scientist. I hope to build a solid foundation in R and R Studio and am excited to learn more about interpreting data without being misleading. I also hope to be part of a successful team in this class, where we can all grow our skills and learn about how to effectively collaborate in business and research conditions.

My hobbies include paddleboarding, hiking, ice skating, tennis, and organizing. In fact, if I didn't love Statistics as much as I do, I would be going to school for psychology in order to become a professional organizer.

###Derek

A question I would like to know the answer to that could be answered by analyzing data?

Is there an easy and objective way to distinguish fake news and propaganda from factual journalism?

What would I love to be doing six months after graduation?
Performing services in exchange for currency
(real answer: getting a masters in machine learning)

What would I love to be doing 5 years after that?
Performing comparable services in exchange for more currency
(real answer: working at a machine learning startup)

What you hope your greatest career accomplishment will be?
Contributing in a non-negligible way to the development of AGI

What am I hoping to learn in this course?
Useful data science and collaboration skills 

What is something else about me?
I am an excellent cook.
