2. At least one (non-statistics) question you would like to know the answer to that could be answered by analyzing data

How did you hear from our restaurant? 
How long have you used our products/services? 

3. What you would love to be doing six months after graduation and then five years after that (what would make you excited to be doing?)

Six month after graduation, I plan to attend graduate school and I will be majoring statistics, during this time, I should have finished 1st semester graduate study. I also have some understanding about statistics (at least for some programming skills in R). After five years, I should finish my graduate study and work in the company. In the future, I plan to do some work relate to statistics and apply my knowledge into real life, help people solve problems. 

4. What you hope your greatest career accomplishment will be and given these hopes and goals, what you are hoping to learn/accomplish/do in this course

I hope to use my statistics knowledge and programming skills to get my jobs and applying knowledge into real world. Based on aim, I would need to learn basic programming skills and try to solve problems from small areas. R could be one of the most important tools in analyzing and cooperating data in different area. Therefore, I want to learn R in this course. 


5. You must also include something of your own choosing not described above. Anything. Be creative!

If I become a statistician, I would like to establish some statistics lab in all parts of the world, and help them in different areas based knowledge of statistics.
