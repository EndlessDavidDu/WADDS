### Sarah Individual
A question I would want to answer in Lab 8 is what trends are there in animals entering and leaving a humane society? A backup question would be which factors result in animals getting adopted most frequently in a humane society?

These are important questions because, with this information, a humane society could have a better idea of where to put their resources in order to maximize the number of animals they save, and they could also gain information on what steps could be taken to get more animals adopted. These questions are interesting to me because I interned at the Humane Society of Boulder Valley last spring and have been involved there ever since; it would be interesting to find out if there was any information from our data that could benefit them. Since the Austin Animal shelter has a similar mission as the Humane Society of Boulder Valley, the data from their shelter might be a good place to start.
